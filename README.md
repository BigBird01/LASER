# LASER (a toolkit for Large scAle diStributEd tRaining)
A toolkit for large scale distributed training

With LARSER we succeeded to train [DeBERTa 1.5B](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa) model without model parallelism. The **DeBERTa 1.5B** model is the SOAT model on [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard) and [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard) leaderboard. And it's the first model that surpass **T5 11B model** and human performance on SuperGLUE leaderboard.
